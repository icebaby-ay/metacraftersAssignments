# Project Title - ICECOIN TOKEN CONTRACT

THIS IS A SIMPLE TOKEN CONTRACT WRITTEN IN SOLIDITY

## Description

THE TOKEN CAN BE DEPLOYED USING REMIX
WITHIN THE CONTRACT EACH USER (ADDRESS) HAS A TOKEN BALANCE
THE BALANCE OF ANY USER CAN BE INCREASED USING THE MINT FUNCTION
THE BALANCE OF ANY USER CAN BE DECREASED USING THE BURN FUNCTION
TOKENS CANNOT BE TRANSFERRED

## Getting Started

CREATE A FILE NAMED ice.sol IN THE REMIX IDE
COPY AND PASTE THE CODE IN ice.sol INTO THE FILE IN THE REMIX IDE
COMPILE THE CONTRACT MyToken IN  ice.sol

### Installing

* YOU CAN DEPLOY THE CODE TO ANY BLOCKCHAIN
* YOU CAN ALSO DEPLOY TO THE REMIX VM
* DEPLOY WITHIN THE REMIX IDE
* THE REMIX IDE WILL PROVIDE AN INTERFACE FOR INTERACTING WITH THE CONTRACT

### Executing program

WITHIN THE REMIX IDE AFTER DEPLOYING ARE SIX FUNCTIONS
HERE IS AN OVERVIEW OF HOW TO USE THOSE FUNCTIONS

    FUNCTION        INPUTS          OUTPUT / EFFECT

    mint         address,amount    NO OUTPUT
                                CREATES NEW TOKENS INTO THE PROVIDED ADDRESS

    burn        address,amount     NO OUTPUT
                                DESTROYS TOKENS BELONGING TO THE PROVIDED ADDRESS GIVEN THAT IT HAS THEM



## Help

PROBLEMS WITH THE CONTRACT

    IT DOESN'T FIT THE ERC20 TOKEN STANDARD
    ANYONE CAN CREATE TOKENS
    ANYONE CAN DESTROY ANYONE ELSE'S TOKENS
    TOKENS CANNOT BE TRANSFERRED

IF THERE ARE ANY PROBLEMS WITH THE README, I'D LIKE TO KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THEY ARE
